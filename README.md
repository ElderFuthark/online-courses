# Furthering my education...

All of the folders here correspond to free courses I've taken from open education platforms such as Coursera and edX.

## File Structure
Courses I've taken are subdivided: first, by the platform they're offered (ex: Coursera, edX), and second, by the course name. As most online courses follow a weekly schedule, each course contains folders corresponding to the week of a given assignment.
